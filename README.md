Async+ for Swift provides a simple **chainable interface** for your async and throwing code, similar to promises and futures.  Have the best of both worlds: you can use the async solution built into the language, but keep all the useful features of promises.

### ‚úèÔ∏è  Usage

Basic chaining operations are:

* `.then` arranges blocks one after another, passing along any values

* `.recover` recovers from a thrown error with a backup value (or block to run)
* `.catch` catches any errors (and allows you to throw new ones for later catch blocks)
* `attempt { ... }` kicks off a chain as in the example below:

```swift
attempt {
    return try await getThing()
}.recover {
    error in
    return try await backupGetThing(error)
}.then {
    thing in
    await thing.doYour()
}.catch {
    error in
    alert(error)
}
```

For comparison, if we tried to write the above flow without Async+ we'd get something like this:


  ```swift
  Task.init {
      do {
          let thing: Thing
          do {
              thing = try await getThing()
          } catch {
              thing = try await backupGetThing(error)
          }
          await thing.doYour()
      } catch {
          error in
          alert(error)
      }
  }
  ```

Async+ allows async and/or throwing code to remain unnested, modular, and concise.  For a full list of operations see the [documentation](Documentation/index.md).

Want to still use chained code within a `do`/`catch` block, `Task.init`, or similar context? Easy: chains are fully interoperable with async and/or throwing contexts via the operations `.async()`, and `.asyncThrows()` at the end of the chain, for example:

```
let foo = await attempt{ ... }.then{ ... }.async() // non-throwing chain
let foo = try await attempt{ ... }.then{ ... }.asyncThrows() // throwing chain
```
If the chain doesn't throw you will not be able to call `asyncThrows` on it (it is a `Guarantee<T>` type rather than a `Promise<T>` type), and vice versa.  Similarly, chains with potential for uncaught errors will raise an unused value warning at compilation time.

### üíæ  Installation

Install the Async+ **SwiftPM** package in Xcode by going to `<your project> -> <ProjectName> -> Package Dependencies -> "+"` and entering: `https://github.com/async-plus/async-plus.git`

Or modify your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/async-plus/async-plus.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 1),
] 
```

To use Async+ in a Swift file you must add `import AsyncPlus` to the top of the file.
